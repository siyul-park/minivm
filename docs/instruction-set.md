# Instruction Set Reference

Complete opcode reference for minivm.

## Agent Usage

Semantic source of truth for adding/debugging opcodes.

- Opcode byte order: `instr/opcode.go`; append new opcodes, never insert between existing ones.
- Operand widths: `instr/type.go`; handler widths must match exactly.
- Threaded behavior: `interp/threaded.go`.
- JIT status: `interp/jit_arm64.go`.
- Semantics changes require this table plus `instr/` and `interp/` tests.

All opcodes are 1 byte. Operands are fixed-width or length-prefixed.

## Execution Semantics

Unless noted:

- operands are little-endian
- stack operands pop right-to-left
- comparisons push `I32(0)` or `I32(1)`
- ref-exposing instructions retain refs
- ref-overwriting instructions release replaced refs
- runtime traps panic and are recovered by `interp.Run`

## JIT Status

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ✅ | native ARM64 |
| ◐ | partially JIT compiled, guarded, or kept as a framed fallback boundary |
| ⬜ | threaded-only |

## Operand Width Notation

Declared in `instr/type.go`.

| Notation | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `{n}` | fixed `n`-byte operand |
| `{-n, n}` | count byte + `count × n`-byte values |

Examples: `{2}` = one u16; branch opcodes interpret it as i16. `{-2, 2}` = count byte + repeated u16 operands.

## Branch Offsets

Branch operands are relative to instruction end:

```text
target = instruction_start + instruction_width + operand
```

Offsets are signed 16-bit values encoded little-endian. `BR 5` skips 5 bytes past the 3-byte `BR`; `BR 0` is fall-through; `BR -3` jumps back to the branch instruction.

## Stack Manipulation

| Opcode | Widths | Stack | JIT | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `NOP` | `{}` | `→` | ✅ | No-op. Normal threaded execution collapses NOP runs into one dispatch; `WithTick(1)` preserves per-instruction hooks. JIT emits nothing. |
| `DROP` | `{}` | `x →` | ✅ | Pop/discard top value. |
| `DUP` | `{}` | `x → x x` | ✅ | Duplicate top value. |
| `SWAP` | `{}` | `a b → b a` | ✅ | Swap top two values. |
| `SELECT` | `{}` | `a b cond → x` | ✅ | Push `a` if `cond ≠ 0`, else `b`. |
| `UNREACHABLE` | `{}` | `→` | ⬜ | Trap with `ErrUnreachableExecuted`; used as dead-code filler before DCE compaction. |

## Control Flow

| Opcode | Widths | Stack | JIT | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `BR` | `{2}` | `→` | ◐ | Unconditional relative jump. Trace JIT records the observed path and exits or continues through learned branch traces. |
| `BR_IF` | `{2}` | `cond →` | ◐ | Jump if `cond ≠ 0`, else fall through. JIT only for simple stack shapes. |
| `BR_TABLE` | `{-2, 2}` | `index →` | ◐ | Jump table; negative or out-of-range index uses default target. JIT only for simple stack shapes. |
| `CALL` | `{}` | `fn →` | ◐ | Call `*Function`, `*HostFunction`, or `*Closure`; trace JIT lowers observed direct calls, small same-arity function-value indirect dispatches, and eligible closure-body calls to native `BL`. Host calls and misses fall back. |
| `RETURN` | `{}` | `→` | ◐ | Return from current frame; trace JIT lowers entry returns and stitches inlined callee returns. |
| `RETURN_CALL` | `{}` | `args… fn →` | ⬜ | Tail call: pops args + funcref like `CALL`, but reuses the current frame so tail recursion runs in constant frame depth. Above the entry frame the frame is replaced in place; at the entry frame a new frame is pushed (callee returns to the entry frame normally). Target must be a `*Function` or `*Closure`; a host-function target is invoked in place and its results returned. Result arity should match the current function's. |

## Variables

| Opcode | Widths | Stack | JIT | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `GLOBAL_GET` | `{2}` | `→ x` | ◐ | Push global at u16 index. JIT supports in-range numeric, dynamic `ref`, and guarded ref-counted heap values; heap-promoted `i64` exits to threaded execution. |
| `GLOBAL_SET` | `{2}` | `x →` | ◐ | Store global at u16 index. JIT supports numeric, dynamic `ref`, and guarded ref-counted heap values. |
| `GLOBAL_TEE` | `{2}` | `x → x` | ◐ | Store global and keep value. JIT supports the same guarded paths as `GLOBAL_SET`. |
| `LOCAL_GET` | `{1}` | `→ x` | ◐ | Push u8 local relative to frame base. JIT supports params/locals including dynamic `ref` slots; heap-promoted `i64` exits to threaded execution. |
| `LOCAL_SET` | `{1}` | `x →` | ◐ | Store u8 local. JIT supports numeric, dynamic `ref`, and guarded ref-counted heap values. |
| `LOCAL_TEE` | `{1}` | `x → x` | ◐ | Store local and keep value. JIT supports the same guarded paths as `LOCAL_SET`. |
| `CONST_GET` | `{2}` | `→ x` | ◐ | Push u16 constant. JIT supports boxed numeric constants and function constants used by direct/indirect calls; ordinary heap ref constants stay threaded. |

## References

| Opcode | Widths | Stack | JIT | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `REF_NULL` | `{}` | `→ ref` | ✅ | Push `BoxedNull`, heap index `0`. |
| `REF_IS_NULL` | `{}` | `ref → i32` | ✅ | Push `I32(1)` if null, else `I32(0)`. |
| `REF_EQ` | `{}` | `a b → i32` | ✅ | Push `I32(1)` if refs point to same heap index. |
| `REF_NE` | `{}` | `a b → i32` | ✅ | Push `I32(1)` if refs differ. |
| `REF_TEST` | `{2}` | `any → i32` | ⬜ | Push `I32(1)` if the value matches the type at u16 index. Accepts any operand: a `KindRef` is matched against the heap object's `Type()`; a primitive is matched against its own kind. |
| `REF_CAST` | `{2}` | `any → any` | ⬜ | Trap with `ErrTypeMismatch` if the value does not cast to the type at u16 index. Accepts both `KindRef` and primitive operands (primitives use `Boxed.Type()`). |
| `REF_NEW` | `{}` | `x → ref` | ◐ | Box a non-ref scalar (`I32/I64/F32/F64`) onto the heap as a mutable cell; trap `ErrTypeMismatch` on a ref operand. JIT keeps framed entries by exiting locally to the threaded handler. |
| `REF_GET` | `{}` | `ref → x` | ◐ | Load the scalar held by a cell; trap `ErrTypeMismatch` if the target is not a scalar. Consumes (releases) the ref. JIT has native fast paths for `I32`, `F32`, and `F64`; `I64` cells fall back. |
| `REF_SET` | `{}` | `ref x →` | ◐ | Overwrite a cell's scalar; trap `ErrTypeMismatch` if `x` is a ref. Consumes (releases) the ref. JIT keeps framed entries by exiting locally to the threaded handler. |

A `ref`-typed slot is the VM's dynamic ("any") type: it holds any `Boxed` — an inline primitive or a `KindRef` — and `REF_TEST`/`REF_CAST` recover the runtime type. See [value-representation.md](value-representation.md#dynamic-any-values).

## Closures

| Opcode | Widths | Stack | JIT | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `CLOSURE_NEW` | `{}` | `upval1 … upvalN fn → closure` | ◐ | Pop the `*Function` template (top of stack, like `call`), read `N = len(fn.Captures)`, pop N upvalues below it, and push a `*Closure` capturing them. Ownership of `fn` and the upvalues transfers into the closure. JIT keeps framed entries by exiting locally to the threaded handler. |
| `UPVAL_GET` | `{1}` | `→ x` | ◐ | Push the closure upvalue at u8 index; traps `ErrSegmentationFault` outside a closure frame or out of range. Closure-body JIT supports guarded upvalue loads. |
| `UPVAL_SET` | `{1}` | `x →` | ◐ | Store into the closure upvalue at u8 index (persists across calls to the same closure); same trap conditions as `UPVAL_GET`. Closure-body JIT supports guarded ref-counted stores. |

## String Operations

| Opcode | Widths | Stack | JIT | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `STRING_NEW_UTF32` | `{}` | `array → string` | ⬜ | Create `types.String` from UTF-32 codepoints. |
| `STRING_LEN` | `{}` | `string → i32` | ⬜ | Push string length in codepoints. |

| `STRING_ENCODE_UTF32` | `{}` | `string → array` | ⬜ | Encode string as UTF-32 codepoints. |

## Array Operations

| Opcode | Widths | Stack | JIT | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ARRAY_NEW` | `{2}` | `value count → array` | ◐ | Create typed array filled with `value`. JIT keeps framed entries by exiting locally to the threaded handler. |
| `ARRAY_NEW_DEFAULT` | `{2}` | `count → array` | ◐ | Create zero-initialized typed array. JIT keeps framed entries by exiting locally to the threaded handler. |
| `ARRAY_LEN` | `{}` | `array → i32` | ◐ | Push element count. JIT has native fast paths for VM arrays. |
| `ARRAY_GET` | `{}` | `array index → value` | ◐ | Load element; trap `ErrIndexOutOfRange` on invalid index. JIT has native fast paths for `[]i8`, `[]i32`, `[]f32`, `[]f64`, and generic `[]ref`; `[]i64` falls back when boxing would be needed. |
| `ARRAY_SET` | `{}` | `array index value →` | ◐ | Store element. JIT keeps framed entries by exiting locally to the threaded handler. |
| `ARRAY_FILL` | `{}` | `array offset count value →` | ◐ | Fill range with repeated value. JIT keeps framed entries by exiting locally to the threaded handler. |
| `ARRAY_COPY` | `{}` | `dst dstOffset src srcOffset count →` | ◐ | Copy elements between arrays. JIT keeps framed entries by exiting locally to the threaded handler. |

`[]i8` arrays (binary blobs) share these opcodes. Stack values are `i32`; `ARRAY_GET` zero-extends a byte to `BoxI32(0..255)`, and `ARRAY_SET`/`ARRAY_FILL` narrow via low-byte truncation (`int8(val.I32())`). No overflow trap on narrowing — the storage cell holds raw bits.

## Struct Operations

| Opcode | Widths | Stack | JIT | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `STRUCT_NEW` | `{2}` | `fields → struct` | ◐ | Create struct from field values. JIT keeps framed entries by exiting locally to the threaded handler. |
| `STRUCT_NEW_DEFAULT` | `{2}` | `→ struct` | ◐ | Create zero-initialized struct. JIT keeps framed entries by exiting locally to the threaded handler. |
| `STRUCT_GET` | `{}` | `struct index → value` | ◐ | Load struct field. JIT has native fast paths for VM `*types.Struct` fields that are `i32`, `f32`, `f64`, or `ref`; `i64` boxing and `HostObject` fall back. |
| `STRUCT_SET` | `{}` | `struct index value →` | ◐ | Store struct field. JIT keeps framed entries by exiting locally to the threaded handler. |

## Map Operations

Map keys use primitive value identity for `i32`, `i64`, `f32`, and `f64`; all ref-typed keys use heap ref identity. Missing keys read as element zero value. `MAP_LOOKUP` also returns `I32(1)` for present and `I32(0)` for missing.

| Opcode | Widths | Stack | JIT | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `MAP_NEW` | `{2}` | `k1 v1 ... kn vn count → map` | ◐ | Create typed map from key/value pairs; later duplicate keys overwrite earlier values. JIT keeps framed entries by exiting locally to the threaded handler. |

| `MAP_LEN` | `{}` | `map → i32` | ◐ | Push entry count. JIT keeps framed entries by exiting locally to the threaded handler. |
| `MAP_GET` | `{}` | `map key → value` | ◐ | Load value or element zero value when key is missing. JIT keeps framed entries by exiting locally to the threaded handler. |
| `MAP_LOOKUP` | `{}` | `map key → value ok` | ◐ | Load value plus presence flag. JIT keeps framed entries by exiting locally to the threaded handler. |
| `MAP_SET` | `{}` | `map key value →` | ◐ | Insert or replace entry. JIT keeps framed entries by exiting locally to the threaded handler. |
| `MAP_DELETE` | `{}` | `map key →` | ◐ | Delete entry; missing key is a no-op. JIT keeps framed entries by exiting locally to the threaded handler. |
| `MAP_CLEAR` | `{}` | `map →` | ◐ | Delete all entries. JIT keeps framed entries by exiting locally to the threaded handler. |
| `MAP_KEYS` | `{}` | `map → array` | ⬜ | Snapshot keys into a new `[]K` array (`K` = map key type), in unspecified order. Enables guest map iteration with `ARRAY_LEN`/`ARRAY_GET` + `MAP_GET`. |
