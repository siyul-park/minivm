# Instruction Set Reference

Complete opcode reference for minivm.

## Agent Usage

Semantic source of truth for adding/debugging opcodes.

- Opcode byte order: `instr/opcode.go`; append new opcodes, never insert between existing ones.
- Operand widths: `instr/type.go`; handler widths must match exactly.
- Threaded behavior: `interp/threaded.go`.
- JIT status: `interp/jit_arm64.go`.
- Semantics changes require this table plus `instr/` and `interp/` tests.

All opcodes are 1 byte. Operands are fixed-width or length-prefixed.

## Execution Semantics

Unless noted:

- operands are little-endian
- stack operands pop right-to-left
- comparisons push `I32(0)` or `I32(1)`
- ref-exposing instructions retain refs
- ref-overwriting instructions release replaced refs
- runtime traps panic and are recovered by `interp.Run`

## JIT Status

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ✅ | native ARM64 |
| ◐ | partially JIT compiled, guarded, or kept as a framed fallback boundary |
| ⬜ | threaded-only |

## Operand Width Notation

Declared in `instr/type.go`.

| Notation | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `{n}` | fixed `n`-byte operand |
| `{-n, n}` | count byte + `count × n`-byte values |

Examples: `{2}` = one u16; branch opcodes interpret it as i16. `{-2, 2}` = count byte + repeated u16 operands.

## Operand Kinds

`i32`, `i8`, and `i1` share one representation (tag bit `0b100`), the 32-bit
slot, and the `i32.*` operators — the JVM "computational type" model. See
[value-representation.md](value-representation.md#computational-types-i1-i8).
Consequences for the tables below:

- Any opcode that lists an `i32` operand also accepts `i8`/`i1` (matched by
  representation, in both the verifier and the JIT).
- Rows that push a boolean — comparisons, `*.eqz`, `ref.is_null`,
  `ref.eq`/`ref.ne`, `ref.test`, and the `string` comparisons — are written
  `→ i32` for brevity, but their **runtime kind is `i1`** (the engines box
  through `BoxI1` / push `KindI1`).
- `i32.and` / `i32.or` / `i32.xor` are width-closed: when both operands share one
  narrow kind the result keeps it (`i8 & i8 → i8`, `i1 ^ i1 → i1`); a mixed pair
  widens to `i32`. All other arithmetic widens narrow operands to `i32`.

## Branch Offsets

Branch operands are relative to instruction end:

```text
target = instruction_start + instruction_width + operand
```

Offsets are signed 16-bit values encoded little-endian. `BR 5` skips 5 bytes past the 3-byte `BR`; `BR 0` is fall-through; `BR -3` jumps back to the branch instruction.

## Stack Manipulation

| Opcode | Widths | Stack | JIT | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `NOP` | `{}` | `→` | ✅ | No-op. Normal threaded execution collapses NOP runs into one dispatch; `WithTick(1)` preserves per-instruction hooks. JIT emits nothing. |
| `DROP` | `{}` | `x →` | ✅ | Pop/discard top value. |
| `DUP` | `{}` | `x → x x` | ✅ | Duplicate top value. |
| `SWAP` | `{}` | `a b → b a` | ✅ | Swap top two values. |
| `SELECT` | `{}` | `a b cond → x` | ✅ | Push `a` if `cond ≠ 0`, else `b`. |
| `UNREACHABLE` | `{}` | `→` | ⬜ | Trap with `ErrUnreachableExecuted`; used as dead-code filler before DCE compaction. |

## Control Flow

| Opcode | Widths | Stack | JIT | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `BR` | `{2}` | `→` | ◐ | Unconditional relative jump. Trace JIT records the observed path and exits or continues through learned branch traces. |
| `BR_IF` | `{2}` | `cond →` | ◐ | Jump if `cond ≠ 0`, else fall through. JIT only for simple stack shapes. |
| `BR_TABLE` | `{-2, 2}` | `index →` | ◐ | Jump table; negative or out-of-range index uses default target. JIT only for simple stack shapes. |
| `CALL` | `{}` | `fn →` | ◐ | Call `*Function`, `*HostFunction`, or `*Closure`; trace JIT lowers observed direct calls, small same-arity function-value indirect dispatches, and eligible closure-body calls to native `BL`. Host calls and misses fall back. |
| `RETURN` | `{}` | `→` | ◐ | Return from current frame; trace JIT lowers entry returns and stitches inlined callee returns. |
| `RETURN_CALL` | `{}` | `args… fn →` | ◐ | Tail call: pops args + funcref like `CALL`, but reuses the current frame so tail recursion runs in constant frame depth. Above the entry frame the frame is replaced in place; at the entry frame a new frame is pushed (callee returns to the entry frame normally). Target must be a `*Function` or `*Closure`; a host-function target is invoked in place and its results returned. Result arity should match the current function's. Trace JIT lowers plain-function targets: a tail call back to the trace anchor becomes a native loop back-edge (self/mutual recursion in constant depth), a tail call to another function morphs the frame in place. Host and closure targets fall back. |

## Variables

`LOCAL_*` address the current frame's slots by u8 index. The entry (module) frame has slots too when the program declares `Program.Locals` (`program.WithLocals` / `Builder.Locals`): top-level code then uses frame locals for scratch instead of reserving globals, and interpreter, fusion, and JIT treat them identically to function locals.

| Opcode | Widths | Stack | JIT | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `GLOBAL_GET` | `{2}` | `→ x` | ◐ | Push global at u16 index. JIT supports in-range numeric, dynamic `ref`, and guarded ref-counted heap values; heap-promoted `i64` exits to threaded execution. |
| `GLOBAL_SET` | `{2}` | `x →` | ◐ | Store global at u16 index. JIT supports numeric, dynamic `ref`, and guarded ref-counted heap values. |
| `GLOBAL_TEE` | `{2}` | `x → x` | ◐ | Store global and keep value. JIT supports the same guarded paths as `GLOBAL_SET`. |
| `LOCAL_GET` | `{1}` | `→ x` | ◐ | Push u8 local relative to frame base. JIT supports params/locals including dynamic `ref` slots; heap-promoted `i64` exits to threaded execution. |
| `LOCAL_SET` | `{1}` | `x →` | ◐ | Store u8 local. JIT supports numeric, dynamic `ref`, and guarded ref-counted heap values. |
| `LOCAL_TEE` | `{1}` | `x → x` | ◐ | Store local and keep value. JIT supports the same guarded paths as `LOCAL_SET`. |
| `CONST_GET` | `{2}` | `→ x` | ◐ | Push u16 constant. JIT supports boxed numeric constants and function constants used by direct/indirect calls; ordinary heap ref constants stay threaded. |

## References

| Opcode | Widths | Stack | JIT | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `REF_NULL` | `{}` | `→ ref` | ✅ | Push `BoxedNull`, heap index `0`. |
| `REF_IS_NULL` | `{}` | `ref → i32` | ✅ | Push `I32(1)` if null, else `I32(0)`. |
| `REF_EQ` | `{}` | `a b → i32` | ✅ | Push `I32(1)` if refs point to same heap index. |
| `REF_NE` | `{}` | `a b → i32` | ✅ | Push `I32(1)` if refs differ. |
| `REF_TEST` | `{2}` | `any → i32` | ⬜ | Push `I32(1)` if the value matches the type at u16 index. Accepts any operand: a `KindRef` is matched against the heap object's `Type()`; a primitive is matched against its own kind. |
| `REF_CAST` | `{2}` | `any → any` | ⬜ | Trap with `ErrTypeMismatch` if the value does not cast to the type at u16 index. Accepts both `KindRef` and primitive operands (primitives use `Boxed.Type()`). |
| `REF_NEW` | `{}` | `x → ref` | ◐ | Box a non-ref scalar (`I32/I64/F32/F64`) onto the heap as a mutable cell; trap `ErrTypeMismatch` on a ref operand. JIT keeps framed entries by exiting locally to the threaded handler. |
| `REF_GET` | `{}` | `ref → x` | ◐ | Load the scalar held by a cell; trap `ErrTypeMismatch` if the target is not a scalar. Consumes (releases) the ref. JIT has native fast paths for `I32`, `F32`, and `F64`; `I64` cells fall back. |
| `REF_SET` | `{}` | `ref x →` | ◐ | Overwrite a cell's scalar; trap `ErrTypeMismatch` if `x` is a ref. Consumes (releases) the ref. JIT keeps framed entries by exiting locally to the threaded handler. |

A `ref`-typed slot is the VM's dynamic ("any") type: it holds any `Boxed` — an inline primitive or a `KindRef` — and `REF_TEST`/`REF_CAST` recover the runtime type. See [value-representation.md](value-representation.md#dynamic-any-values).

## Closures

| Opcode | Widths | Stack | JIT | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `CLOSURE_NEW` | `{}` | `upval1 … upvalN fn → closure` | ◐ | Pop the `*Function` template (top of stack, like `call`), read `N = len(fn.Captures)`, pop N upvalues below it, and push a `*Closure` capturing them. Ownership of `fn` and the upvalues transfers into the closure. JIT keeps framed entries by exiting locally to the threaded handler. |
| `UPVAL_GET` | `{1}` | `→ x` | ◐ | Push the closure upvalue at u8 index; traps `ErrSegmentationFault` outside a closure frame or out of range. Closure-body JIT supports guarded upvalue loads. |
| `UPVAL_SET` | `{1}` | `x →` | ◐ | Store into the closure upvalue at u8 index (persists across calls to the same closure); same trap conditions as `UPVAL_GET`. Closure-body JIT supports guarded ref-counted stores. |

| `ARRAY_COPY` | `{}` | `dst dstOffset src srcOffset count →` | ◐ | Copy elements between arrays. JIT keeps framed entries by exiting locally to the threaded handler. |
| `ARRAY_APPEND` | `{}` | `array v1 … vn count → array` | ◐ | Append `count` elements (in stack order) to the end and grow in place; re-pushes the array ref for chaining. Variable arity, so the verifier treats it as indeterminate (like `MAP_NEW`). JIT keeps framed entries by exiting locally to the threaded handler. |
| `ARRAY_DELETE` | `{}` | `array index → value` | ◐ | Remove the element at `index`, shift the tail left, shrink by one, and push the removed value; trap `ErrIndexOutOfRange` on an invalid index. JIT keeps framed entries by exiting locally to the threaded handler. |
| `ARRAY_SLICE` | `{}` | `array start end → array` | ◐ | Allocate a new array holding a copy of `[start, end)`, element type derived from the source; trap `ErrIndexOutOfRange` unless `0 ≤ start ≤ end ≤ len`. JIT keeps framed entries by exiting locally to the threaded handler. |

Arrays are **growable**: `ARRAY_NEW`/`ARRAY_NEW_DEFAULT` set the initial length, and `ARRAY_APPEND`/`ARRAY_DELETE` change it afterward (amortized via the backing Go slice). `ARRAY_APPEND` takes its element count on the stack, matching the `MAP_NEW` convention, and **moves** the values into the array (no extra retain). `ARRAY_DELETE` is the single removal primitive and returns the removed element, so both `del a[i]` (discard the result with `DROP`) and a stack `pop` (`… DUP ARRAY_LEN <i32 1> SUB ARRAY_DELETE`) compose from it — there is no separate `ARRAY_POP`. The removed element is **moved** to the stack (unlike `ARRAY_GET`, which copies and retains). `ARRAY_SLICE` **retains** the ref elements it copies into the new array; like `ARRAY_GET` it consumes (releases) the source array ref, so `DUP` first to keep the source. Iteration needs no dedicated opcode: arrays are O(1)-indexable, so an `ARRAY_LEN` + `ARRAY_GET` index loop already covers it (`MAP_ITER` exists only because Go maps lack indexing).

`[]i8` arrays (binary blobs) share these opcodes. `ARRAY_GET` returns a signed `i8` (`BoxI8`, `-128..127`); `ARRAY_SET`/`ARRAY_FILL` narrow via low-byte truncation (`int8(val.I32())`), accepting any `i32`-representation value. No overflow trap on narrowing — the storage cell holds raw bits. Mask `& 0xFF` for the unsigned `0..255` reading. `[]i1` arrays use raw 1-byte `bool` cells: `ARRAY_GET` returns `BoxI1`; `ARRAY_SET`/`ARRAY_FILL` store `val.Bool()` (non-zero ⇒ true).

## Struct Operations

| Opcode | Widths | Stack | JIT | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `STRUCT_NEW` | `{2}` | `fields → struct` | ◐ | Create struct from field values. JIT keeps framed entries by exiting locally to the threaded handler. |
| `STRUCT_NEW_DEFAULT` | `{2}` | `→ struct` | ◐ | Create zero-initialized struct. JIT keeps framed entries by exiting locally to the threaded handler. |
| `STRUCT_GET` | `{}` | `struct index → value` | ◐ | Load struct field. JIT has native fast paths for VM `*types.Struct` fields that are `i32`, `f32`, `f64`, or `ref`; `i64` boxing and `HostObject` fall back. |
| `STRUCT_SET` | `{}` | `struct index value →` | ◐ | Store struct field. JIT keeps framed entries by exiting locally to the threaded handler. |

## Map Operations

Map keys use primitive value identity for `i1`, `i8`, `i32`, `i64`, `f32`, and `f64` (each with a dedicated `TypedMap`); all ref-typed keys use heap ref identity. Missing keys read as element zero value. `MAP_LOOKUP` also returns `I32(1)` for present and `I32(0)` for missing.

| Opcode | Widths | Stack | JIT | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `MAP_NEW` | `{2}` | `k1 v1 ... kn vn count → map` | ◐ | Create typed map from key/value pairs; later duplicate keys overwrite earlier values. JIT keeps framed entries by exiting locally to the threaded handler. |
| `MAP_NEW_DEFAULT` | `{2}` | `capacity → map` | ◐ | Create empty typed map with capacity hint. JIT keeps framed entries by exiting locally to the threaded handler. |
| `MAP_LEN` | `{}` | `map → i32` | ◐ | Push entry count. JIT keeps framed entries by exiting locally to the threaded handler. |
| `MAP_GET` | `{}` | `map key → value` | ◐ | Load value or element zero value when key is missing. JIT keeps framed entries by exiting locally to the threaded handler. |
| `MAP_LOOKUP` | `{}` | `map key → value ok` | ◐ | Load value plus presence flag. JIT keeps framed entries by exiting locally to the threaded handler. |
| `MAP_SET` | `{}` | `map key value →` | ◐ | Insert or replace entry. JIT keeps framed entries by exiting locally to the threaded handler. |
| `MAP_DELETE` | `{}` | `map key →` | ◐ | Delete entry; missing key is a no-op. JIT keeps framed entries by exiting locally to the threaded handler. |
| `MAP_CLEAR` | `{}` | `map →` | ◐ | Delete all entries. JIT keeps framed entries by exiting locally to the threaded handler. |
| `MAP_KEYS` | `{}` | `map → array` | ⬜ | Snapshot keys into a new `[]K` array (`K` = map key type), in unspecified order. Enables guest map iteration with `ARRAY_LEN`/`ARRAY_GET` + `MAP_GET`. |
| `MAP_ITER` | `{}` | `map[K]V → iterator[K]` | ⬜ | Create a `types.MapIterator` over the map without snapshotting keys, advance it to the first key, and transfer map ownership into the iterator. The iterator yields keys only; use `MAP_GET` when the value is needed. Iteration order and mutation visibility are unspecified, matching Go map range semantics. |

## Coroutines

A function whose body contains `YIELD` is a coroutine-function: its `CALL` allocates a `Coroutine` handle and runs the body until the first `YIELD` (suspend) or `RETURN` (finish), yielding the handle instead of plain returns. `RESUME` re-enters a suspended handle. A `YIELD` in the entry frame (`fp == 1`) is an interpreter escape: it panics the private `errYield`, `Run` returns the exported `ErrYield` without losing state, and the next `Run` resumes after the `YIELD`. `RESUME`, `CORO_DONE`, and `CORO_VALUE` also accept custom `types.Iterator` heap values; iterators are single-value producers whose `Current` value is read with `CORO_VALUE`. Native iterator types use `iterator[T]` descriptors, where `T` is the produced value type.

| Opcode | Widths | Stack | JIT | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `YIELD` | `{}` | `value → result` | ◐ | Suspend the current coroutine frame, capturing `value` into the handle and unwinding to the caller; `RESUME` later delivers its in-value as `result`. In the entry frame it escapes via `ErrYield`. JIT records a `YIELD` reached in the trace's anchor frame as a terminal and lowers it to an unconditional deopt that runs the threaded suspend; a `YIELD` inside an inlined callee frame aborts the trace. |
| `RESUME` | `{}` | `coro in → coro` | ◐ | Resume a suspended coroutine handle, delivering `in` as the pending `YIELD`'s result, or advance a `types.Iterator` while ignoring `in`. Traps `ErrCoroutineDone` if already finished. JIT lowers an anchor-frame `RESUME` to a terminal deopt that runs the threaded resume. |
| `CORO_DONE` | `{}` | `coro → i32` | ◐ | Push `I32(1)` if the coroutine or iterator has finished, else `I32(0)`; does not release the handle. JIT has a native fast path for `*Coroutine` behind an itab guard and falls back for custom iterators. |
| `CORO_VALUE` | `{}` | `coro → value` | ◐ | Push the coroutine's last yielded/returned value or the iterator's current value, then release the handle. JIT has a native fast path for `*Coroutine` behind an itab guard and falls back for custom iterators. |

## Exceptions

Exception handling uses a per-function exception table rather than block-bracket
opcodes, matching the JVM/CLR/CPython "zero-cost" model: protected regions are
metadata on the function (`types.Function.Handlers`, and `program.Program.Handlers`
for the top-level slot 0), so code that never throws pays nothing — the table is
consulted only while unwinding.

Each `instr.Handler` is a byte-IP range `[Start, End)` with a `Catch` target and a
`Depth` (the stack height `sp-bp` at the region's entry). Build regions with
`Builder.Try(start, end, catch, depth)`; declare inner regions before the outer
ones that enclose them so the table stays innermost-first.

`THROW` pops a value and unwinds to the nearest enclosing handler: it walks frames
from the throw site outward (using the call site, `ip-1`, in suspended callers),
discards the frames and operands above the handler's `Depth`, pushes the thrown
value, and resumes at `Catch`. Any value may be thrown; `types.Error` is the
canonical payload and implements Go's `error` interface. It carries a numeric
code, message, payload, and optional wrapped Go cause. Code `0` is unclassified;
source-language codes should use `types.ErrorCodeUserBase` and above; VM traps
use negative `interp.TrapCode*` codes. Runtime traps (e.g. `ErrDivideByZero`) and
host-function Go errors are caught the same way: `Run`'s recover wraps them in a
`types.Error` (preserving the original via `Unwrap` for `errors.Is`/`errors.As`)
and delivers them to a covering handler. With no handler, a thrown `types.Error`
surfaces directly through the returned `*RuntimeError`; any other value is
wrapped under `ErrUncaughtException`.

| Opcode | Widths | Stack | JIT | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `THROW` | `{}` | `value → …` | ◐ | Pop and raise `value` to the nearest enclosing handler, or escape `Run` as an error when none covers the site. Terminator. JIT records an anchor-frame throw as a terminal deopt and lets the threaded handler land the exception. |
| `ERROR_NEW` | `{}` | `payload code → error` | ◐ | Wrap `payload` in a `types.Error` with `i32` code (message derived from a string payload's contents, else its rendered form); the payload reference transfers into the error. JIT records it as a terminal deopt so allocation stays threaded. |
| `ERROR_GET` | `{}` | `error → payload` | ◐ | Push the `types.Error`'s payload and release the error. Traps `ErrTypeMismatch` if the operand is not an error. JIT has a native fast path for `*types.Error` behind an itab guard. |
| `ERROR_CODE` | `{}` | `error → i32` | ◐ | Push the `types.Error`'s numeric code and release the error. Traps `ErrTypeMismatch` if the operand is not an error. JIT records it as a terminal deopt for now. |

The threaded dispatcher still fuses common idioms in non-precise mode: a constant string load followed by `i32.const code; ERROR_NEW` builds the error in one dispatch, and `ERROR_NEW; THROW` constructs and raises in one.
